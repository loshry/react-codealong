## Why have we refactored the project?

The project is growing and we are going to introduce multiple pages to it.

The previous content from the App has been moved into the Home container. The App is now going to be responsible for navigating around the application rather then what is being shown. We will leave this to the containers.

The user state, artist and album data is needed in multiple places in the project. This is why it is being kept in the app so it can be passed with props.

---

## What is a SPA and how do we add react-router to our project?

A SPA is a web application or website that dynamically rewrites the current web page instead loading entire new pages.

_The docs are currently for v5 and they are on v6 of react router. The docs may have changed so you will have to check_

The things that have changed are:

- The `<Switch/>` component is now called `<Routes/>`
- You can't use `props.children`. Instead you have a `element` prop on the `<Route/>` component, that is the component you want to go to.

Show them either:

- [React Router Docs](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- If the docs are still v5 [React Router Docs - Upgrading v5 to v6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5)

React router is the package we will use to implement routing in our project. There are others.

Highlight that the React router doc's are easy to follow.

To add it to the project run.

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

---

## Part 1: How can we implement routing in our Application?

Once the package has been installed we can use the components to add routing.

In App.jsx import the following components.

_We are using `BrowserRouter as Router` to be consistent with the react router docs._

```jsx
// App.jsx

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
```

Wrap the entire application inside the Router component. If you want to use routing it has to be inside this component.

Add the Routes component below the Nav. Inside the Routes use the Route component.

Inside the Route add a element prop add the Home component.

Add the path prop to Route and set the value to "/". This is going to be the default path. If it does not find a route it will take us to this page.

```jsx
// App.jsx

return (
  <Router>
    <div className="app">
      <Nav
        userName={`${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`}
        handleUserChange={handleUserChange}
      />

      <Routes>
        <Route
          path="/"
          element={
            <Home
              user={user}
              unsortedAlbums={filteredAlbums}
              sortedAlbums={highestRating}
              artist={artist}
            />
          }
        ></Route>
      </Routes>
    </div>
  </Router>
);
```

Thats setting up the path now we need to link to it.

In the NavMenu import the Link, replace `<p className="nav-menu__item" >Home</p>` with the Link component.

Add the to prop to the Link and set the value to "/". Add the toggleNav to run onClick to hide the nav once the link has been clicked.

```jsx
// NavMenu.jsx

import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

// In the return NavMenu.jsx
<Link className="nav-menu__item" to="/" onClick={toggleNav}>
  Home
</Link>;
```

## Creating AlbumGallery container

This is going to be a reuseable page to link to. It takes a title and albumsArr as props.

It filters the albumsArr remove any albums without img URLs , it then maps over to create a array of the img URLS. This will be given to the Carousel component.

In src/containers create the AlbumGallery folder and jsx and scss files.

The completed files are below;

<details>
<summary>AlbumGallery.jsx</summary>

```jsx
// AlbumGallery.jsx

import "./AlbumGallery.scss";

import Carousel from "../../components/Carousel/Carousel";

const AlbumGallery = (props) => {
  const { albumsArr, title } = props;

  const imagesArr = albumsArr
    .filter((album) => album.strAlbumThumb)
    .map((album) => album.strAlbumThumb);

  return (
    <section className="album-gallery">
      <h1 className="album-gallery__heading">{title}</h1>

      <div className="album-gallery__carousel">
        <Carousel imagesArr={imagesArr} />
      </div>
    </section>
  );
};

export default AlbumGallery;
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>AlbumGallery.scss</summary>

```scss
// AlbumGallery.scss

.album-gallery {
  &__heading {
    padding: 0 50px;
    font-size: 30px;
    text-align: center;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 992px) {
  .album-gallery {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    gap: 25px 50px;
    padding: 0 50px;

    &__heading {
      grid-column: 1 / -1;
      padding: 0;
    }

    &__carousel {
      width: 100%;
      grid-column: 2/4;
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Part 2: How can we implement routing in our Application?

It is time to hook up our new page.

In App.jsx import in the AlbumGallery container. Add a new Route to the Routes component. Set the path prop on the Route to "/albums".

Inside the Route add the element prop and add the AlbumGallery component and give it the albumsArr and title props it needs.

```jsx
// App.jsx

<Routes>
  <Route
    path="/albums"
    element={<AlbumGallery albumsArr={filteredAlbums} title={"All Albums"} />}
  />

  <Route
    path="/"
    element={
      <Home
        user={user}
        unsortedAlbums={filteredAlbums}
        sortedAlbums={highestRating}
        artist={artist}
      />
    }
  />
</Routes>
```

In the NavMenu add a new link to take you to that page.

```jsx
// NavMenu.jsx

<Link className="nav-menu__item" to="/albums" onClick={toggleNav}>
  All Albums
</Link>
```

## Move onto Challenges

**Once the Challenge is completed there is a code exploring query params**
**The second challenge is for after you cover query params**

- [Challenge](./challenge/challenge.md)
- [Solution](./challenge/solution.md)

---

## How can we use Query Params from the URL?

Query parameters are a defined set of parameters at the end of a URL. They are used to help define individual content for a page.

Lets update the AlbumTiles component. We want to make it so when you click on the image of the album it takes you to a page with more information about that album.

Import the Link component.

In the AlbumTiles.jsx update the cardListJSX variable. Now it should wrap the `<img/>` with the Link component.

The to prop on the Link is going to go to /album/idAlbum.

The idAlbum is going to be the id from each of the albums objects.

You will need to move the key prop to the Link component.

```jsx
// AlbumTiles.jsx

const cardListJSX = albumsArr.map((album, index) => (
  <Link to={`/album/${album.idAlbum}`} key={title + (index + 1)}>
    <img
      className="album-tiles__img"
      src={album.strAlbumThumb}
      alt={album.strAlbum}
    />
  </Link>
));
```

## Creating the AlbumInfo container

The AlbumInfo container will get take the array of albums and use the id from the query params to get the object it needs to populate the page with the correct information.

Create an AlbumInfo folder, jsx nd scss files. The starter code is below.

<details>
<summary>AlbumInfo.jsx</summary>

```jsx
// AlbumInfo.jsx
import "./AlbumInfo.scss";

const AlbumInfo = (props) => {
  const { albumsArr } = props;

  return (
    <article className="album-info">
      <div className="album-info__banner">
        <img className="album-info__img album-info__img--first" />
      </div>
      <div className="album-info__content">
        <h2 className="album-info__heading">ALBUM-TITLE</h2>
        <p>ALBUM-TEXT</p>
        <h2 className="album-info__heading">Facts</h2>
        <ul className="album-info__facts">
          <li>Mood : ALBUM-MOOD </li>
          <li>Released : ALBUM-YEAR-RELEASED </li>
          <li>Genre : ALBUM-GENRE </li>
          <li>Score : ALBUM-SCORE </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="album-info__banner">
        <img className="album-info__img album-info__img--last" />
      </div>
    </article>
  );
};

export default AlbumInfo;
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>AlbumInfo.scss</summary>

```scss
// AlbumInfo.scss
@use "../../assets/sass/variables" as *;

.album-info {
  &__banner {
    overflow: hidden;
    background-color: $color-black;
    height: 35vh;
    position: relative;
  }

  &__img {
    border-radius: 15px;
    width: calc(100% - 100px);
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);

    &--first {
      top: 50px;
    }

    &--last {
      bottom: 50px;
    }
  }

  &__content {
    padding: 10px 50px;
  }

  &__facts {
    list-style-type: none;
    padding: 0;
  }

  &__heading {
    font-size: 30px;
    width: fit-content;
    &:after {
      content: "";
      display: block;
      height: 5px;
      width: 100%;
      background-color: $color-primary;
      border-radius: 15px;
    }
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 992px) {
  .album-info {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    border-radius: 15px;
    overflow: hidden;
    margin: 50px 50px;
    box-shadow: 0px 10px 20px rgba($color-black, 0.25);
    min-height: 60vh;

    &__banner {
      height: 100%;
      background-color: unset;
    }

    &__img {
      width: unset;
      height: 100%;
      left: unset;
      transform: unset;
      top: 0;
      opacity: 0.8;

      &--first {
        left: 0;
      }

      &--last {
        right: 0;
      }
    }

    &__heading {
      margin: 0 auto;
    }
  }
}
```

</details>
<br/>

Import the useParams hook in the container. Inside the function use the useParam hook, destruct it and log the result to the console.

_You wont see anything yet as you need to set up the route in App_

```jsx
// AlbumInfo.jsx

import { useParams } from "react-router";

const { albumId } = useParams();
console.log(albumId);
```

In App.jsx inside the Routes set up a new route to the AlbumInfo container. Set the path to go to `/album/:albumId`. :albumId represents the query param.

```jsx
// AlbumInfo.jsx

<Route
  path="/album/:albumId"
  element={<AlbumInfo albumsArr={filteredAlbums} />}
/>
```

Demonstrate the query param logged to the console when you click on a album. It is now down to use the id to find the album and use the data to populate the page.

Go to the second challenge on the challenge.md.

## Optional Bug squash

If you go to the `/albums` page and click through the `Carousel` and then go to the `/albums/rated` page. The `/albums/rated` will be on whatever index on the `Carousel` you were on on the `/albums` page.

The state from the component is persisting.

We can squash this bug by adding a different key prop to each of the `<AlbumGallery/>` components. React can now tell they are different and will rerender and reset the state when you change page.

```jsx
  <Route
    path="/albums"
    element={<AlbumGallery key="albums" albumsArr={filteredAlbums} title={"All Albums"} />}
  />
  <Route path="/album/:albumId" element={<AlbumInfo albumsArr={filteredAlbums} />} />
  <Route
    path="/albums/rated"
    element={<AlbumGallery key="rated" albumsArr={highestRating} title={"Rated Albums"} />}
  />
```
